    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>That's because blended cheeses must be labeled as "processed" cheese or "cheese product." According to no less of
        an
        authority than Cheese.com, the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations regards American cheese as a type of
        "pasteurized
        processed cheese." To the letter of the law, what we know as American cheese exists in the legal lexicon as "a
        stable concoction of natural cheese cheese bits mixed with emulsifying agents" used to make "a homogenous
        plastic
        mass." You can thank the natural cheese lobby, who wanted to differentiate themselves from Kraft et. al, for
        that
        particular definition. In truth, the "plastic" part sounds scarier than it is: It essentially functions as an
        adjective that describes something as easily shaped or molded, which, to be fair, could describe a lot of
        different
        types of cheese. </p>
    <p>Believe it or not, "plastic" isn't the worst thing American cheese could have been called. Kraft's pasteurized
        cheese
        had so incensed those natural cheese makers that they took to calling American cheese "embalmed cheese" and
        pushed
        hard for government regulators to do the same. Why? Because sodium phosphate, an emulsifier used in processed
        cheese
        to prevent globs of fat from pooling on the processed cheese's surface, was also used to â€¦ embalm corpses.
        Luckily
        for Kraft and co., the government went with the comparatively favorable "plastic." </p>
